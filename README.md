# teamRosterGenerator

* This application allows you to build your very own team of professions
which includes a manager, a group of engineers and of course interns. Once the node packages are successfully installed you'll be prompted with a list of questions that verify the information of the professions that you want on your team. After you have selected your team an html should appear inside of the teamRoster folder with all of professions that you have darted to be on your team as well as there given information.

- Run npm install to install node packages.
- Run npm start to begin building your roster.
